I couldn't help but notice how beautiful the weather was today while returning home from brunch. The sky was a perfect blue, the winds were fresh but warm, and the sun was casting amazing shadows from the trees. One of those perfect weather day's that you would kick yourself for staying in. As soon as I got home I pulled my bike out from the garage, wiped the spiders off, pumped up the wheels, and rode away. I always forget how happy it makes me to go out for a bike ride until I'm actually riding. So glad I did. :D

Today's ride in Pasadena:

- Caltech
- San Marino
- Huntington Gardens
