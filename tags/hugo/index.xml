&lt;p&gt;Rebuilt from the ground up, the new site is refined from the presentation to the
source. The theme has been modernized to load faster and I created more ways to
navigate the site so more data is easily accessible while keeping the idea of
simplicity in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the site is more than just a pretty face. As a DIY’er, I take pleasure
in building something from the ground up. The previous versions were powered by
Wordpress. It’s amongst the most popular blogging technologies but honestly
maintaining it is a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also more goals in mind with the new site that will encourage more
postings and in effect be the personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;technologies:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is no longer powered by a backend technology that has to be coupled
with a database. This made issues when trying to upgrade and keep up to date.
Now we’re a fully statically generated site. This has a lot of benefits such as
less server maintenance (virtually none) and much faster load times from the
user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hugo:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the a new player to the top static site generators out there today. I
initially tried porting over my site from Wordpress with Jekyll. It wasn’t as
straight forward as I thought it would be. There were a few bumps on the road
were taking away from my fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up choosing Hugo because it was easy to get an example site up and
running very quick. It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles that Jekyll might
but I realized that I didn’t need them. There is also something to be said about
Hugo’s speed. It’s a big deal when creating a new page because the generator has
to rebuild just about every page. Being written in Go was a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things that I thought were really nice out of the box was the web server,
sitemap generator, and RSS support. Not to mention the whole application is a
single binary app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;xhtml:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;XHTML&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is mainly a matter of preference. It bothers me that you don’t have to
close certain tags in HTML which is why I prefer XHTML. I like to keep some sort
of sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cringe every time I think of how browsers must parse standard HTML. I think of
the days when I was a fresh programmer at my first job and tasked with data
mining from websites using PHP. Oh, we just went to a dark place didn’t we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sass-susy-css3:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;SASS + SUSY + CSS3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes back to my DIY nature. I don’t like using pre-built frameworks like
Twitter’ Bootstrap because it seems to be a lot of overkill for doing a few
simple things. Sometimes you have to use so many CSS classes to achieve
something and it feels dirty, similar to writing inline styles. I like running
lean and mean, that’s always been my motto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;es6-babel:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;ES6 + Babel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, JavaScript sucks. We all know it. A lot of the time it doesn’t
make sense which is probably why it’s so closely related to HTML. Nonetheless
it’s a necessary evil. ES6 sucks a lot less by letting you regain some amount of
sanity. Using Babel I can future proof my code and start using the technologies
of tomorrow, today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;jquery:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;jQuery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meh. Not much to say about jQuery. Let’s just move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;handlebars:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Handlebars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic client side library for building templates. I’m a huge fan.
Not currently using it at the moment of this writing but it’s baked into the JS
application ready to go. It will be used in future plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;prismjs:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;PrismJS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source code viewer you see throughout the site is using PrismJS. I have to
give it two thumbs up. One for following standards and another for looking
awesome. I just wish they had a better way of building custom packages. Oh well,
beggars can’t be choosers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;services:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that this is a 100% static site, I need a few services to help with features
needing a backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;github:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub just get’s it. Get it? Thanks to their static website hosting I don’t
have to pay a dime or manage a server anymore. Instead I just create a repo and
run my website off a branch. Having your SCM and website coupled together like
this is very pleasant and makes for a simple deploy process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention this site is now completely open source?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mailchimp:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Mailchimp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please signup to the newsletter if you want to stay up to date. I’m planning on
doing only one newsletter a month if there is a decent amount of subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dedicated-to-my-daughter:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Dedicated to my daughter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site is dedicated to my daughter, Eva. May all your dreams come true.&lt;/p&gt;
