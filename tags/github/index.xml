      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Rebuilt from the ground up, the new site is refined from the presentation to the
source. The theme has been modernized to load faster and I created more ways to
navigate the site so more data is easily accessible while keeping the idea of
simplicity in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the site is more than just a pretty face. As a DIY’er, I take pleasure
in building something from the ground up. The previous versions were powered by
Wordpress. It’s amongst the most popular blogging technologies but honestly
maintaining it is a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also more goals in mind with the new site that will encourage more
postings and in effect be the personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;technologies:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is no longer powered by a backend technology that has to be coupled
with a database. This made issues when trying to upgrade and keep up to date.
Now we’re a fully statically generated site. This has a lot of benefits such as
less server maintenance (virtually none) and much faster load times from the
user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hugo:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the a new player to the top static site generators out there today. I
initially tried porting over my site from Wordpress with Jekyll. It wasn’t as
straight forward as I thought it would be. There were a few bumps on the road
were taking away from my fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up choosing Hugo because it was easy to get an example site up and
running very quick. It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles that Jekyll might
but I realized that I didn’t need them. There is also something to be said about
Hugo’s speed. It’s a big deal when creating a new page because the generator has
to rebuild just about every page. Being written in Go was a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things that I thought were really nice out of the box was the web server,
sitemap generator, and RSS support. Not to mention the whole application is a
single binary app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;xhtml:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;XHTML&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is mainly a matter of preference. It bothers me that you don’t have to
close certain tags in HTML which is why I prefer XHTML. I like to keep some sort
of sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cringe every time I think of how browsers must parse standard HTML. I think of
the days when I was a fresh programmer at my first job and tasked with data
mining from websites using PHP. Oh, we just went to a dark place didn’t we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sass-susy-css3:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;SASS + SUSY + CSS3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes back to my DIY nature. I don’t like using pre-built frameworks like
Twitter’ Bootstrap because it seems to be a lot of overkill for doing a few
simple things. Sometimes you have to use so many CSS classes to achieve
something and it feels dirty, similar to writing inline styles. I like running
lean and mean, that’s always been my motto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;es6-babel:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;ES6 + Babel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, JavaScript sucks. We all know it. A lot of the time it doesn’t
make sense which is probably why it’s so closely related to HTML. Nonetheless
it’s a necessary evil. ES6 sucks a lot less by letting you regain some amount of
sanity. Using Babel I can future proof my code and start using the technologies
of tomorrow, today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;jquery:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;jQuery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meh. Not much to say about jQuery. Let’s just move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;handlebars:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Handlebars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic client side library for building templates. I’m a huge fan.
Not currently using it at the moment of this writing but it’s baked into the JS
application ready to go. It will be used in future plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;prismjs:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;PrismJS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source code viewer you see throughout the site is using PrismJS. I have to
give it two thumbs up. One for following standards and another for looking
awesome. I just wish they had a better way of building custom packages. Oh well,
beggars can’t be choosers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;services:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that this is a 100% static site, I need a few services to help with features
needing a backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;github:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub just get’s it. Get it? Thanks to their static website hosting I don’t
have to pay a dime or manage a server anymore. Instead I just create a repo and
run my website off a branch. Having your SCM and website coupled together like
this is very pleasant and makes for a simple deploy process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention this site is now completely open source?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mailchimp:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Mailchimp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please signup to the newsletter if you want to stay up to date. I’m planning on
doing only one newsletter a month if there is a decent amount of subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dedicated-to-my-daughter:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Dedicated to my daughter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site is dedicated to my daughter, Eva. May all your dreams come true.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to reference Bitbucket commits to Asana</title>
      <link>http://richardsumilang.com/programming/scm/git/how-to-link-bitbucket-to-asana/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 310100 01:01:01 PST</pubDate>

      <guid>http://richardsumilang.com/programming/scm/git/how-to-link-bitbucket-to-asana/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; Use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rsumilang/asana-post-commit&#34; title=&#34;Asana Post Commit&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;post-commit&lt;/strong&gt; hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Spaceman-Labs/asana-post-commit&#34; title=&#34;Asana Post Commit&#34;&gt;this great&lt;/a&gt; git &lt;strong&gt;post-commit&lt;/strong&gt; hook by Spaceman Labs. It works by
adding a comment to your Asana ticket when you reference your commit message by
id. For example, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fixing issue #12345.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; This adds a comment to your ticket:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Just committed %commit-id with message:

&#34;Fixing issue #1234&#34;

to repository %repo-name&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This works by making a curl request to Asana&amp;rsquo;s REST API on your behalf while
sending the above message as the comment. While this is great, it could be
better by providing links to your Bitbucket changeset. I&amp;rsquo;ve made the necessary
edits to do so in the &lt;strong&gt;post-commit&lt;/strong&gt; hook. The updated message now looks like
this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;Committed %link-to-commit with message:

&#34;Fixing issue #1234&#34;

to repository %repo-name&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-it-works:e44030a6eac62837d3575bd8d4698fdd&#34;&gt;How it works&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loop through all the remote repositories configured for the repo and search
for either a bitbucket.org or github.com in their URLs. Once  one is found, I
extract the repo name from the URL and build the link to the changeset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If you are using Github then I recommend  using the free
&lt;a href=&#34;https://asana.com/apps/github&#34; title=&#34;Asana GitHub App&#34;&gt;Asana service&lt;/a&gt; provided. I merely included the GitHub code as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original code from here takes over and parses out the ticket number and does
the curl request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;installation:e44030a6eac62837d3575bd8d4698fdd&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grab my edited &lt;strong&gt;post-commit&lt;/strong&gt; hook from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rsumilang/asana-post-commit&#34; title=&#34;Asana Post Commit&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; and drop it into your repos
&lt;code&gt;.git/hooks&lt;/code&gt; directory. Make sure to &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; the file to &lt;code&gt;0755&lt;/code&gt;. Lastly, grab
your &lt;a href=&#34;http://app.asana.com/-/account_api&#34; title=&#34;Asana Account API&#34;&gt;Asana key&lt;/a&gt; and run &lt;code&gt;git config --global user.asana-key
&amp;quot;MY_ASANA_API_KEY&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;afterthoughts:e44030a6eac62837d3575bd8d4698fdd&#34;&gt;Afterthoughts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you have any suggestions. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of possibly editing
the git commit message to link back to the Asana ticket for the sake of
cross-linking but this might require additional configuration&amp;hellip; Unless project
id is added as part of the ticket number. Ie: #&lt;sup&gt;12345&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;98765&lt;/sub&gt;. Please feel free to
add your input! :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FTP Sync Script</title>
      <link>http://richardsumilang.com/unix-like/linux/ftp/ftp-sync-script/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 96 Aug 270900 09:09:09 PST</pubDate>

      <guid>http://richardsumilang.com/unix-like/linux/ftp/ftp-sync-script/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Digging around my hard drive and found an old FTP sync script I wrote. Sharing
it on GitHub now. Enjoy :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rsumilang/sync-ftp&#34; title=&#34;ftp sync script&#34;&gt;https://github.com/rsumilang/sync-ftp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: If you have the ability to send files in any other way like SSH then I&amp;rsquo;d
advise using rsync. FTP should be a last resort.&lt;/p&gt;
