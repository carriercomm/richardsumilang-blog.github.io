&lt;p&gt;There you have it. All the parts that I&amp;rsquo;ll be assembling for the Bottlehead
S.E.X. version 2.1. The parts in the image include the impedance switch and the
C4S components. To the far left, there is a bag I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother unraveling
because it is mainly little screws and bolts that felt easy to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;build-order:1b4dc4da085555f81049b926eba0bf59&#34;&gt;Build Order&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will do incremental builds. This way I can test the quality of a build on it&amp;rsquo;s
own before adding additional components. This is a good practice I follow in
daily software development and has proved helpful in debugging. The order will
be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S.E.X. kit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impedance switch installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C4S Upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;customizations:1b4dc4da085555f81049b926eba0bf59&#34;&gt;Customizations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I dive directly into the build I will need to do a few customizations. I
figure it will be easier to do this now before the parts are assembled because
they will not be easily accessible later. The order will be as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottlehead PC-3 painting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sanding and varnishing the wood frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nickeling metal components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Bottlehead S.E.X. 2.1 Journey</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;After almost a month of waiting, my &lt;a href=&#34;http://bottlehead.com/?product=single-ended-experimenters-kit-2-1-for-headphones-sensitive-speakers&#34; title=&#34;Bottlhead S.E.X. kit for Headphones and Sensitive Speakers&#34;&gt;Bottlehead S.E.X.&lt;/a&gt; has finally arrived.
This will be my first of many electronic DIY projects. I will detail the journey
from start to finish. Including details like what tools I used, any problems
I encountered, and any suggestions I come up with on the way. This blog series
is sort of like an enhancement to the original guide provided with your
&lt;a href=&#34;http://bottlehead.com/?product=single-ended-experimenters-kit-2-1-for-headphones-sensitive-speakers&#34; title=&#34;Bottlhead S.E.X. kit for Headphones and Sensitive Speakers&#34;&gt;Bottlehead S.E.X.&lt;/a&gt; purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-it-started:dac6b9559e4c567b0be6a4a74c7d7d81&#34;&gt;How it started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally I had ordered the &lt;a href=&#34;http://bottlehead.com/?product=crack-otl-headphone-amplifier-kit&#34; title=&#34;Bottlehead Crack OTL Amplifier Kit&#34;&gt;Bottlehead Crack OTL Amplifier Kit&lt;/a&gt; with the
Speedball Upgrade. This amplifier is widely known as a great way to get into
audiophile DIY world and great for driving high impedance headphones like the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1Kf3W3v&#34; title=&#34;Sennheiser HD 650 Open Back Professional Headphone&#34;&gt;Sennheiser HD 650&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s and &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/1Kf4eaH&#34; title=&#34;Sennheiser HD 800 Over-Ear Circum-Aural Dynamic Headphone&#34;&gt;Sennheiser HD 800&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s, which were the headphones
I was rocking at the time. While there are plenty of other amplifiers out in the
market, I chose to go this route for the sake of learning and building something
which seems a lot more fun than just shelling out cash on amplifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-why-did-i-switch-to-the-s-e-x:dac6b9559e4c567b0be6a4a74c7d7d81&#34;&gt;So why did I switch to the S.E.X.?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply because I like to experiment with a range of setup combinations, thus I
look for versatility in my setups. That is where the Single Ended eXperiement
comes in; or S.E.X. for short. I want the ability to use my amplifier with a wide
range of headphones and power desktop speakers. The S.E.X. has an output
impedance upgrade option that makes this easily possible. The S.E.X. defaults to
your speakers when there isn&amp;rsquo;t a pair of headphones plugged into the jack. While
I&amp;rsquo;m going all out, why not upgrade to the C4S load boards, right? Makes sense to
me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-beauty-of-it:dac6b9559e4c567b0be6a4a74c7d7d81&#34;&gt;The beauty of it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest benefits of DIY besides a fun project and learning, is the
ability to customize everything to your liking. My amplifier at the end will not
look like the stock Bottlehead S.E.X. pictures. This journey will include,
varnishing, painting, and a custom nickeling job for a sweet hot rod look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion:dac6b9559e4c567b0be6a4a74c7d7d81&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be posting a progress updates approximately once a week. As with
everything else on this blog, we&amp;rsquo;re here to learn and experiment. There might be
errors or perhaps some better way to do things. I would love to hear any
questions or suggestions in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to unlink Netflix from Panasonic Viera Cast VT25</title>
      <link>http://richardsumilang.com/electronics/tv/panasonic/unlink-netflix-from-panasonic-viera-cast-vt25/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately you can&amp;rsquo;t on a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-TC-P58VT25-1080p-VIERA-Plasma/dp/B003N3BV5O&#34; title=&#34;Panasonic VT25&#34;&gt;Panasonic VT25&lt;/a&gt;. Someone managed to forget
about that feature on the Netflix app. Weird because it&amp;rsquo;s there for YouTube,
Pandora, Amazon, etc&amp;hellip; The only way you can is by resetting your TV to the
factory settings and starting from scratch. You&amp;rsquo;re wrong if you think you can
just log into your Netflix account and click the unlink all devices link from
your profile. On the plus side&amp;hellip; Never mind, there is no plus side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would highly recommend using another device such as a PlayStation, Roku, or
anything else to view your Netflix since they are far better. The Viera Cast
implementation is also lacking a search feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to go ahead reset your TV to the factory settings then be sure to
back up the following settings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network Settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picture Settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viera Cast app arrangements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
