&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to announce &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.losslesslife.com/&#34; title=&#34;The world&#39;s finest Audiophile Electronics. Headphones, DACs, Amplifiers, reviews, and more.&#34;&gt;LosslessLife&lt;/a&gt;, a company focusing on the best
high resolution audio gear. LosslessLife reflects the continuous hard work
and commitment in the products it believes in by creating a voice to get the
word out from the audiophile communities and to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is often assumed by the average consumer that a higher price and/or bigger
brand name results in better product. While this can be true to some degree,
consumers are often paying more for a product&amp;rsquo;s marketing expenses when
purchasing from large retail stores rather than receiving higher performing
product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strict factors such as performance, output quality, and the overall
craftsmanship of products must be met in order to make it to LosslessLife as the
company name is synonymous with the highest level of quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a market that is saturated with mediocre products, LosslessLife believes it&amp;rsquo;s
success will be by educating consumers to make smarter choices when purchasing.
We do the research for you and provide &lt;a href=&#34;http://pages.losslesslife.com/&#34; title=&#34;Covering everything from high-end and audiophile headphones. Headphones and headphone amplifiers, accessories, how-to guides, and reviews.&#34;&gt;all of the facts&lt;/a&gt; in an unbiased
fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While many companies sell products which they claim they would use, LosslessLife
only sells products it does use by it&amp;rsquo;s highly enthusiastic team with
backgrounds in technology, production, and an affinity for music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;stay-informed:807d3c434bb3f9df2e43e9f8eb694daf&#34;&gt;Stay informed&lt;/h1&gt;

      <title>TMZ Mobile Website</title>
      <link>http://richardsumilang.com/etc/work/tmz/tmz-mobile-web-version-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 96 Aug 220900 09:09:09 PST</pubDate>
      <author>Richard Sumilang</author>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;It has been an exciting journey from start to finish. As the head developer of
the mobile website for one of the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest blog sites, I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to
announce &lt;em&gt;Version 2&lt;/em&gt; of TMZ! Take a look at all the new features. I think you
will like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The views and opinions shared in this article are those of the author&amp;rsquo;s (Richard
Sumilang) and do not necessarily reflect TMZ, Telepictures, Warner Bros and any
staff member or affiliate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-role:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;My role&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a full time developer at TMZ. I work on TMZ products such as the desktop
site and internal applications. My current focus is bringing the technologies up
to date with modern standards while enhancing the user experience on the mobile
website. In other words, creating a brand new product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-s-more-than-just-a-pretty-face:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s more than just a pretty face&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new site provides a new fun and modern interface to interact with TMZ&amp;rsquo;s
content. It borrows designs from our native mobile applications so you feel at
home; but they have been optimized for the mobile web browsing experience. It&amp;rsquo;s
lighter, faster, and full of new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inside has been built from the ground up. While I would like to write a
series of articles detailing the various technologies I chose to build the
application, I will say ECMAScript 6 proved itself suitable as the front-end
language and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to continue upgrading the application to ECMAScript 7,
ECMAScript 8, and so fourth as JavaScript continues to gain sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;show-me-the-features:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;Show me the features!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you will notice is a fresh skin. It&amp;rsquo;s clean, intuitive, and
brings the familiarity you would expect out of a mobile website. The large
images help you find the content you are looking for while continuing to load
more articles into the feed as you scroll, keeping your browsing experience
smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://richardsumilang.com/images/etc/work/tmz/tmz-mobile-web-version-2/homepage.png&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;navigation-menu:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;Navigation Menu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the top left we have a menu button that pulls out a panel to allow navigation
to each section of the site. Starting from the top, you can find the &amp;ldquo;Got a tip?&amp;rdquo;
button where you can submit tips directly to TMZ. Following that we have each of
our site sections in big easily clickable buttons. Below that is a &amp;ldquo;Mobile
Alerts&amp;rdquo; button allowing you to register and receive mobile alerts sent directly
to your phone. The &amp;ldquo;TV Listings&amp;rdquo; displays TMZ show listings for your area. Or if
you&amp;rsquo;re feeling like going on a tour then you can click the &amp;ldquo;TMZ Celebrity Tour&amp;rdquo;
and reserve a spot on the bus and tour hollywood. The &amp;ldquo;Login / Register&amp;rdquo; button
signs you into TMZ, allowing you to add your own comments to articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://richardsumilang.com/images/etc/work/tmz/tmz-mobile-web-version-2/nav-menu.png&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;got-a-tip:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;Got A Tip?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling TMZ directly is still an option by clicking the &amp;ldquo;Give us a call&amp;rdquo; button.
The new section now supports sending TMZ a direct email via a web form with the
ability to upload files from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://richardsumilang.com/images/etc/work/tmz/tmz-mobile-web-version-2/got-a-tip.gif&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;news:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news contains tabs to help you sort the content in your preferred order. For
example, this feed defaults to the &lt;strong&gt;Latest&lt;/strong&gt; articles and provides you the
options of sorting by most &lt;strong&gt;Popular&lt;/strong&gt; and the most &lt;strong&gt;Commented&lt;/strong&gt; trending
results. The &lt;strong&gt;Popular&lt;/strong&gt; tab labels each article with a number for it&amp;rsquo;s
popularity. The &lt;strong&gt;Commented&lt;/strong&gt; section similarly labels each article with the
number of comments per article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://richardsumilang.com/images/etc/work/tmz/tmz-mobile-web-version-2/news-feed.gif&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;article-page:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;Article Page&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking an article thumbnail brings you to a beautiful view of the article that
is easy to read. The cover is either an image, video, or gallery. You can tell
what the media type is because there is either a large play button for video or
gallery icon for galleries. You can click the primary media in the cover to load
the media right away or you can scroll down the article. As you scroll you will
notice buttons for sharing an article on your social networks and the comment
count next to the article details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the article details there can be links to more related galleries, videos,
images, polls, and a number of other items (depending on what the content writer
chose to include).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking on the comment bubble next to the article details, or the large comment
count below the article will show load all the comments. You may log in here
using one of many social network authentications (Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, etc)
to share your thoughts. If you are already logged into the mobile website with
your TMZ account then you can comment immediately. Closing the comment page will
bring you back to the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below you will find other related articles that you may find interesting. The
want more section will display buttons to bios of celebrities mentioned in the
article and buttons to article categories that you also may find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end you will see a link to the next article from the feed you came from.
If you did not land on the article page coming from a feed then you will not see
this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://richardsumilang.com/images/etc/work/tmz/tmz-mobile-web-version-2/article-page.gif&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;videos:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;Videos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Featuring &lt;em&gt;Latest Videos&lt;/em&gt; by default, TMZ now provides access to videos by
&lt;em&gt;Category&lt;/em&gt;. Each video also has it&amp;rsquo;s own page where you can share the current
video with your social networks and find other related videos that you might be
interested in watching next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://richardsumilang.com/images/etc/work/tmz/tmz-mobile-web-version-2/video-latest.png&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;photos:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;Photos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like all the other feeds, bigger images and easier scrolling. The takeaway from
this section is the new thumbnail galleries that you can load by clicking on any
photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the gallery, we use larger images to take up the whole viewport of your phone
to provide a richer experience. You can swipe your thumb on a photo to easily
navigate in the direction you want to go. There are also new sharing features
per photo and more gallery suggestions when reaching the end. I think you&amp;rsquo;ll
like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://richardsumilang.com/images/etc/work/tmz/tmz-mobile-web-version-2/photo-galleries.gif&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sports:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;Sports&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feed is similar to the latest news feed but focuses on the &lt;em&gt;Sports&lt;/em&gt;
category. You can also find sports articles while browsing other article feeds.
You will be able to easily identify a sports article by the green swipe on the
article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://richardsumilang.com/images/etc/work/tmz/tmz-mobile-web-version-2/tmz-sports.png&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;celebs:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;Celebs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the most trending celebrity by navigating to this feed section. This section
defaults to the most &lt;strong&gt;Trending&lt;/strong&gt; celebrities and you can click on the &lt;strong&gt;All&lt;/strong&gt;
tab to find a specific celebrity quicker. The &lt;strong&gt;All&lt;/strong&gt; section loads smaller
thumbnails for faster scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://richardsumilang.com/images/etc/work/tmz/tmz-mobile-web-version-2/celebs.gif&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;celebrity-bio:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;Celebrity Bio&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking on a celebrity will load up a detailed biography page where you can
find more information about a celebrity. Starting from the top, you can share the
celebrity information with your social network, read their bio, find photo
galleries, videos, and/or articles featuring the current celebrity bio you are
reading. We also show related celebrities that you may be interested in
reading about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://richardsumilang.com/images/etc/work/tmz/tmz-mobile-web-version-2/celeb-bio.gif&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shows:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;Shows&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broken up into three sections, TMZ, TMZ Live, and TMZ Sports. You can come to
this section and watch live streaming (for TMZ Live), full episodes, and clips
for any of your favorite shows on your mobile device. You may also use the
button on the bottom of the page to find local TV listings for your area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://richardsumilang.com/images/etc/work/tmz/tmz-mobile-web-version-2/shows.gif&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;search:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;Search&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t find what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for? Try out the new search feature. It uses an
updated backend service to provide you more accurate results than before. From
the search page you will be able to find celebrities, articles, videos, and
galleries. Celebrities will be listed first and the other page types will be
mixed in the results. You can identify each page type by the icons on the
results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://richardsumilang.com/images/etc/work/tmz/tmz-mobile-web-version-2/search-dave.gif&#34; class=&#34;center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;try-it-out-for-yourself:109091b091afade9d62503f31848530f&#34;&gt;Try it out for yourself!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This application is now live. You can access it on your mobile device by going to
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tmz.com&#34;&gt;http://www.tmz.com&lt;/a&gt; or directly to &lt;a href=&#34;http://m.tmz.com&#34;&gt;http://m.tmz.com&lt;/a&gt;. This mobile website is a
huge improvement over the previous implementation and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to have my name
stamped on the face of it. Many thanks to my awesome team for help making this
possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebuilt from the ground up, the new site is refined from the presentation to the
source. The theme has been modernized to load faster and I created more ways to
navigate the site so more data is easily accessible while keeping the idea of
simplicity in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the site is more than just a pretty face. As a DIY’er, I take pleasure
in building something from the ground up. The previous versions were powered by
Wordpress. It’s amongst the most popular blogging technologies but honestly
maintaining it is a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also more goals in mind with the new site that will encourage more
postings and in effect be the personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;technologies:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Technologies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is no longer powered by a backend technology that has to be coupled
with a database. This made issues when trying to upgrade and keep up to date.
Now we’re a fully statically generated site. This has a lot of benefits such as
less server maintenance (virtually none) and much faster load times from the
user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;hugo:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the a new player to the top static site generators out there today. I
initially tried porting over my site from Wordpress with Jekyll. It wasn’t as
straight forward as I thought it would be. There were a few bumps on the road
were taking away from my fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up choosing Hugo because it was easy to get an example site up and
running very quick. It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles that Jekyll might
but I realized that I didn’t need them. There is also something to be said about
Hugo’s speed. It’s a big deal when creating a new page because the generator has
to rebuild just about every page. Being written in Go was a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things that I thought were really nice out of the box was the web server,
sitemap generator, and RSS support. Not to mention the whole application is a
single binary app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;xhtml:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;XHTML&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is mainly a matter of preference. It bothers me that you don’t have to
close certain tags in HTML which is why I prefer XHTML. I like to keep some sort
of sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cringe every time I think of how browsers must parse standard HTML. I think of
the days when I was a fresh programmer at my first job and tasked with data
mining from websites using PHP. Oh, we just went to a dark place didn’t we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sass-susy-css3:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;SASS + SUSY + CSS3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes back to my DIY nature. I don’t like using pre-built frameworks like
Twitter’ Bootstrap because it seems to be a lot of overkill for doing a few
simple things. Sometimes you have to use so many CSS classes to achieve
something and it feels dirty, similar to writing inline styles. I like running
lean and mean, that’s always been my motto.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;es6-babel:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;ES6 + Babel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, JavaScript sucks. We all know it. A lot of the time it doesn’t
make sense which is probably why it’s so closely related to HTML. Nonetheless
it’s a necessary evil. ES6 sucks a lot less by letting you regain some amount of
sanity. Using Babel I can future proof my code and start using the technologies
of tomorrow, today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;jquery:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;jQuery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meh. Not much to say about jQuery. Let’s just move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;handlebars:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Handlebars&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic client side library for building templates. I’m a huge fan.
Not currently using it at the moment of this writing but it’s baked into the JS
application ready to go. It will be used in future plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;prismjs:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;PrismJS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source code viewer you see throughout the site is using PrismJS. I have to
give it two thumbs up. One for following standards and another for looking
awesome. I just wish they had a better way of building custom packages. Oh well,
beggars can’t be choosers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;services:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that this is a 100% static site, I need a few services to help with features
needing a backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;github:678a5ea35242eee10c4a011d0e563269&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub just get’s it. Get it? Thanks to their static website hosting I don’t
have to pay a dime or manage a server anymore. Instead I just create a repo and
run my website off a branch. Having your SCM and website coupled together like
this is very pleasant and makes for a simple deploy process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention this site is now completely open source?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#34;effective. Power&#34; ... An AOL Flashback.</title>

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a popular text message going around today that restarts a recipients
iPhone (if notifications is turned on) when they receive the following text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
effective. 
Power
لُلُصّبُلُلصّبُررً ॣ ॣh ॣ ॣ
冗
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m running iOS 8.3 (12F70). While testing the message, I learned that removing
the &amp;ldquo;effective. Power&amp;rdquo; from the text will also crash my the Message app and
prevent me and my recipient from opening the app. Fun times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
لُلُصّبُلُلصّبُررً ॣ ॣh ॣ ॣ
冗
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can send yourself another text message something like the desktop Messages
app with the same exact text which will cancel out the erroring one. Another
popular technique is to send yourself a text from your photos app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-does-this-work:54ef7fa11b89a091df9a4bb3fcf6ecc0&#34;&gt;How does this work?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is the set of characters used. The Messages app (and possibly
others) try to render the bad text will cause the program manager and windowing
system to crash and reboot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This felt like a modern day AOL punter for me. A punter was usually a feature of
an &amp;ldquo;AOL prog&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;proggie&amp;rdquo; that could sign off anyone you like, similar to this
exploit. A recepient would receive an instant message from you with bad contents
in the message body causing the AOL program to crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny enough, this is where my interest in computer programming began. Oh Visual
Basic&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shout outs to Fate X, Pepsi, HaVok, Pepsi, FireToolz, Fate Zero, Super MaD CoW
97, EXoRCiST, Cold Fusion and many more for making the internet a much more
interesting place to be in the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reflection</title>
      <link>http://richardsumilang.com/etc/reflection/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today was just one of those days that started like any other. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a
lot of reflection over the past few weeks on what are my new goals. The act of
starting a new goal is always exciting but my life is pretty consistent despite
how random it seems. I always start off the day choosing one of my many similar
yet different shirts. Today I chose the shirt labeled Chocolate. I just wanted
someone to read &amp;ldquo;Chocolate&amp;rdquo; aloud so I can reply &amp;ldquo;Melts with in your mouth, not
in your hands.&amp;rdquo; Is that too much to ask for? (Who knows&amp;hellip;) So I go about my day
and start brushing up on PHP namespacing documents. I got some pretty useful
information out of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.basics.php#82088&#34; title=&#34;PHP Namespaces&#34;&gt;top comment&lt;/a&gt; and find out that it was written by me 6
years ago! It felt like the &lt;em&gt;past me&lt;/em&gt; was talking to &lt;em&gt;current me&lt;/em&gt;. A bit trippy
but also a bit embarrassing because I used to be on the bleeding edge of
software development &amp;gt;= 6 years ago. I then joined big corporations. The
technology was usually behind but I did learn a lot in terms of scalability and
working with agile teams. Now in my current role I have the opportunity to do
some really cool stuff which has been a bit of a refresh. It&amp;rsquo;s true what they
say, &amp;ldquo;if you don&amp;rsquo;t use it, you lose it&amp;rdquo;. But that&amp;rsquo;s ok as I was also focusing
more on other aspects in my life rather than just being an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get two food trucks come by the office parking lot during lunch. One was a
rib truck today and the other was some vegan thing. Typically I go straight for
the red meat but I thought I&amp;rsquo;ll be good this one time (at least once this month)
and get a vegan burger. My head was lost in code while I waited for my food. The
lady from the vegan truck called my name and when I picked up my food she said,
&amp;ldquo;mmmm chocolate, I could take you home and eat you for dessert!&amp;rdquo; I was totally
caught off guard without my one-liner ready. I just chuckled, said thank you,
and went back to office. #missedjokeoppurtuniy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cousin and I met up after work as we normally do on Thursdays to have a
drink, talk about life, business, and whatever. I might add that the &amp;ldquo;Mexican&amp;rdquo;
food at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pinktaco.com/&#34; title=&#34;Pink Taco&#34;&gt;Pink Taco&lt;/a&gt; is amazing! My favorite drink lately has been Johnie
Walker black label so I&amp;rsquo;ve been ordering that wherever I go. We were coming to
realizations of where technology and businesses are headed. During the talk we
got comped free Johnnie Walker blue labels by our waiter! I don&amp;rsquo;t even know why
but who can say no to that? As the Gavin Rossdale would say, &amp;ldquo;take life straight
no chaser!&amp;rdquo;  I ended the day by buying a lottery ticket because today seemed
like one of those special occasion weird days and might as well try to exhaust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless I&amp;rsquo;ve been having an itch that needs scratching in regards to
something amazing that needs to be built. Maybe my recent blogs might hint where
things are going. Expect some interesting concepts coming down the pipeline as
I&amp;rsquo;m seeing a reflection of where things were a decade ago and getting the sense
of a full picture. Time will tell!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First day at TMZ</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today marks day 1 of my journey at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tmz.com/&#34; title=&#34;Thirty Mile Zone&#34;&gt;TMZ&lt;/a&gt;. There is an exciting energy in
this environment. The first thing you notice is an open workspace where there is
action going on every minute. (You probably already know that if you&amp;rsquo;ve watched
the show before.) The technology is also very impressive. The team no doubt
consists of nothing but A+ players. How else would TMZ have gotten to be so big
in a short amount of time? I&amp;rsquo;m excited to bring my skills to the team and to see
what the future has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but notice how beautiful the weather was today while returning home from brunch. The sky was a perfect blue, the winds were fresh but warm, and the sun was casting amazing shadows from the trees. One of those perfect weather day&amp;rsquo;s that you would kick yourself for staying in. As soon as I got home I pulled my bike out from the garage, wiped the spiders off, pumped up the wheels, and rode away. I always forget how happy it makes me to go out for a bike ride until I&amp;rsquo;m actually riding. So glad I did. :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s ride in Pasadena:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caltech&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;San Marino&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huntington Gardens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to bring back my blog in order to share  technical notes and observations. I may carry over some content - particularly timeless posts - from my previous blog.  I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to begin a discussion on this blog, so don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to comment on the posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further adieu, welcome to my blog and don&amp;rsquo;t let the door hit you on the way out. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,
Me.&lt;/p&gt;
